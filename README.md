**This is a proposal for adding error wrapping to go.**

**It is a counter-proposal to [Go2 error values](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/29934)**.

This code is not otherwise meant to be imported or used.

The debate is in **TODO** (go issue).

The best way to review the code is via its 
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/JavierZunzunegui/xerrors?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/JavierZunzunegui/xerrors).
The examples in particular have been chosen to easily demonstrate the overall functionality.

There was a [first iteration](https://github.com/JavierZunzunegui/Go2_error_values_counter_proposal) 
of the ideas behind this proposal, but that is now to be regarded as obsolete.
